# Data-Incubator-Project-Proposal

FROM Data Incubator:

Preparing for the Interview: To prepare for the interview, you can brush up on basic probability, statistics, and programming. Most of all, we urge you to be prepared to pitch your project by explaining your analysis and what you hope to do. You will be assessed primarily based on the strength of your existing work and analysis. The strongest candidates continue to work on their projects and present substantially more than they were able to for the challenge. Here are some hints on pitching:

Have a compelling intro: Why should your project be interesting to a broad audience? Being able to relate your project to a personal interest or experience makes the message more interesting.
Have a memorable takeaway: There are two types of takeaways: technical (e.g. improved accuracy by 20%) and fun facts (e.g. charitable giving as a percentage of income is highest for the poorest and wealthiest Americans). You should have both in your presentation. How do you find memorable facts? Slice your dataset by categories that are of broad interest and try lots of ideas and report only the most interesting.
Be specific: Emphasize how much data you analyzed and the tools and techniques you're using (e.g. ran a mapreduce on 60TB of consumer reviews).
Be concise and be prepared: Rehearse your presentation so that you can deliver it concisely in 2-3 minutes. Don't read off a prepared script â€” or at least don't sound like you're doing it!
